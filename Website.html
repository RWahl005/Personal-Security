            Security on the internet has been a battle for many years. For as long as the internet has been a
            thing hackers and hacker groups have been hacking major websites just to get people’s personal
            information so they could either steal their identity or sell their personal information on illegal
            website. If someone clicked on the wrong website or hyperlink they may find themselves with a
            virus. One can also get a virus from other methods to. For instance hackers can also uses email to
            infect people computer with malicious virus. This way of hacking is usually done by the attacker
            sending spam email, and if you are unlucky enough to click on the links they provided you, they
            usually will download a dangerous virus to your computer. Although virus are are a very serious
            threat to people, they are not the only thing to worry about, there is also many scams that lie on
            the internet. Usually these scams will offer free money, free giveaways, and some may even ask you
            to enter your credit information to enter and win a “prize”. Usually these scams are targeted
            towards the elderly people, since they usually don't know what they are doing, and so they fall
            victim to many scams on the internet. Email spamming, or bombing, is also an serious issue that
            everyone faces on the internet. Email bombing is when people “repeatedly sends an identical email
            message to a particular address” in order to convince them to do something or to just advertise a
            product to you <a href="Citations.html#Adeyinka">(Adeyinka 4)</a>. How you could avoid and prevent falling
            victim to most of these scams
            is by being a smart consumer. Look out for deals that look too good to be true, but also avoid
            clicking on suspicious website or emails. There are many ways for someone to get targeted on the
            internet, in order to stay out of trouble it is best to think if the website is credible and if it
            seems to be suspicious.
