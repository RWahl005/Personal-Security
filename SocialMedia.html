            Security in social media has been a major topic recently. It is important to keep one's social media
            account safe as it could contain personal information or leak private information. One way to keep a social
            media account safe it to make a secure password. The “strength of password authentication relies on
            strength of the passwords”; therefore, it is important to make a strong unique password for each social
            media account <a href="Citations.html#ma">(Ma 1)</a>. A benefit to that would be if one account gets
            compromised, hacked, than the rest
            would not be compromised. Just having a good password vastly improves personal security with social media.
            Another way to improve personal security is to restrict who can access your social media pages. If your
            page is not public than it is less known to the public and less likely to be targeted for an attack.
            Someone’s identity can also be stolen online just by social media. Uploading pictures or posting personal
            information can possibly give out enough information for some theft to steal someone's identity with.
            Making a strong password and watching who can see someone's social media page can prevent accounts from
            being compromised.
