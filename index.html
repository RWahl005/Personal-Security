        What Is Personal Securty?
    </h2>
    <p class="rightpad">
        Personal security is essentially the protection of data, network systems, personal information, and much more.
        The protection of these systems are very important because if someone is able to get your personal information
        or able to access a server of a major corporation, then they could cause millions if not billions of dollars in
        damage. They could also be able to steal your identity. Computer security does not only fall into the category
        of personal computers and websites, but it also can be the security of your mobile devices, wireless router,
        security cameras, and all other electronic devices that you may possess. But protecting someone's sensitive
        data from going into the wrong handed has been a battle since the beginning of computing, but today we are
        going to explain more in depth in what personal security is but also how you could protect yourself from hacker
        and scammers.

    <p>
        The protection of your personally data has been a very important issue since the early days of computing. Since
        attackers can compromise your account, which in turn could lead to someone's identity being stolen or
        compromised. Even though there are many threats out there that can be used to harm another person and their
        personal security in the digital world, there are several ways to protect yourself from the threats that face
        them. It is very important to keep anti-virus and anti-malware software installed and up to date to prevent
        some of these issues. Passwords also play a major role in keeping someone safe online. Checking to see if a
        website is legitimate and safe can seriously save someone in the future. Overall, common sense can save someone
        from a lot of trouble in the future with attackers.
