                    Security for a computer can be easy and simple. One of the components that keeps a computer, including it’s users, safe is the firewall. The firewall acts like a “gatekeeper to give access to valid requests” that software makes to get files from the internet <a href="Citations.html#Hawkins">(Hawkins 2)</a>. All computers have firewalls in order to protect them from outside computers/servers that want to access their information. Another threat to most people personal security are virus. What virus are, are a malicious file which its main goals is to harm to the user or machine. A computer can be protected from viruses by using an AntiVirus, a piece of software designed to search computers for known malicious files. “According to Awareness and challenges of Internet security” by <a href="Citations.html#Hawkins">Steve Hawkins</a>, virus detection in Anti-Viruses work by having a list of known virus files, called virus definitions, that are updated on a regular bases <a href="Citations.html#Hawkins">(Hawkins 2)</a>. An Anti-Malware program is similar to an Anti-Virus in that it finds malicious files. Even with all of these fancy software one of the best way to keep a computer threat free is to watch what a person downloads online. If a person only download files from trusted sites than security is not an issue. These tactics can keep a personal computer safe from harm.
