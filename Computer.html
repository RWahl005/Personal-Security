        <h1>Computer Security</h1>
        <p>
            Security for a computer can be easy and simple. One of the components that keeps a computer, including it’s
            users, safe is the firewall. The firewall acts like a “gatekeeper to give access to valid requests” that
            software makes to get files from the internet <a href="Citations.html#Hawkins">(Hawkins 2)</a>. All
            computers have firewalls in order to protect them from outside computers/servers that want to access their
            information. Another threat to most people personal security are virus. What virus are, are a malicious
            file which its main goals is to harm to the user or machine. A computer can be protected from viruses by
            using an AntiVirus, a piece of software designed to search computers for known malicious files. “According
            to Awareness and challenges of Internet security” by <a href="Citations.html#Hawkins">Steve Hawkins</a>,
            virus detection in Anti-Viruses work by having a list of known virus files, called virus definitions, that
            are updated on a regular bases <a href="Citations.html#Hawkins">(Hawkins 2)</a>. An Anti-Malware program is
            similar to an Anti-Virus in that it finds malicious files. Even with all of these fancy software one of the
            best way to keep a computer threat free is to watch what a person downloads online. If a person only
            download files from trusted sites than security is not an issue. These tactics can keep a personal computer
            safe from harm.
